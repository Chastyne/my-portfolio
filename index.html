            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>My journey in tech began in highschool when a group of Ladies in various tech fields visited the school and gave a asnapshot of what they do and wh the do it. Since then I knew I had to get in the tech space.</p>
            <p>I have an undergradguate degree in Computer Technology</p>
            <p>Since graduation I have explored various branches in tech including, backend, Computer Vision(AI) and Devops.</p>
            <p>All these technologies may not be fully visible were it not for front end thus I decided to uptake miniapps as a start as I delve depper into other front end technologies.</p>
